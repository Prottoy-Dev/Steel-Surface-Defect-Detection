# 🧠 Metal Surface Defect Detection Using Deep Learning (NEU Dataset)

This project implements and compares multiple deep learning models for classifying metal surface defects using the **NEU Metal Surface Defects Dataset**. Models include a custom CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and ensemble methods (weighted and stacked). The work aims to improve defect classification performance through experimentation and integration of multiple architectures.

## 📁 Dataset

The NEU dataset contains 6 classes of metal surface defects:

- **Crazing**
- **Inclusion**
- **Patches**
- **Pitted surface**
- **Rolled-in scale**
- **Scratches**
